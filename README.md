Build for production
------------------

```
grunt build
```
Will build the app for production use in `open-budget/dist`.


```
grunt serve:dist
```
Will build the app for production and serve it via local web server at http://localhost:9000
(build = minify the js bundle, minify the compiled css, revving all of the assets and update the references accordingly)

### About the build system
The build system we're using is [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).
The less is also compiled via webpack, with single entry point at the `main.js`. (coffee/js modules dose not have thier own style dependencies declarations), and extracted using ExtractTextPlugin

### JS codebase
Our js code is ES6, transpiled using babel 6, es2015 preset.
We are following [airbnb javascript style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), enforced by eslint. to lint the code use: `grunt eslint`
We strive to convert all the coffeescript code into ES6

###Enjoy!
